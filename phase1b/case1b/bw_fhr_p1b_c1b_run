# [uncomment the following line to enable this]
# cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Alternatively, the job script can create its own job-ID-unique directory
# to run within.  In that case you'll need to create and populate that
# directory with executables and perhaps inputs
# [uncomment and customize the following lines to enable this behavior]
